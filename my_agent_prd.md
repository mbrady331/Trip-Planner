# Product Requirements Document: PRD Helper Agent

## Executive Summary

The **PRD Helper Agent** is an AI-powered system that transforms rough product ideas into comprehensive, structured Product Requirements Documents (PRDs). Built on the proven multi-agent architecture of the AI Trip Planner, this system will help product managers, entrepreneurs, and development teams quickly generate professional PRDs with user stories, success metrics, and technical specifications.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Time-intensive PRD creation**: Product managers spend 8-12 hours creating comprehensive PRDs from scratch
- **Inconsistent structure**: PRDs vary widely in format, completeness, and quality across teams
- **Missing critical elements**: Common omissions include success metrics, user stories, and technical considerations
- **Knowledge gaps**: Junior PMs lack experience in PRD best practices and industry standards
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Difficulty in capturing all stakeholder requirements systematically

### Market Opportunity
- **Target market**: 2.3M product managers globally, growing 15% annually
- **Time savings**: Potential 70% reduction in PRD creation time
- **Quality improvement**: Standardized, comprehensive PRDs improve development outcomes
- **Accessibility**: Democratizes high-quality PRD creation for smaller teams and startups

## Product Vision

**"Transform any product idea into a comprehensive, actionable PRD in minutes, not hours."**

## User Stories

### Primary User: Product Manager
- **As a product manager**, I want to input a rough product idea and receive a structured PRD so that I can focus on strategy rather than document formatting
- **As a product manager**, I want the system to suggest relevant user stories and success metrics so that I don't miss critical requirements
- **As a product manager**, I want to customize the PRD template based on my industry and product type so that the output is relevant to my context

### Secondary User: Startup Founder
- **As a startup founder**, I want to quickly generate investor-ready product documentation so that I can communicate my vision effectively
- **As a startup founder**, I want the system to include market research and competitive analysis so that I can validate my product concept

### Tertiary User: Development Team Lead
- **As a development team lead**, I want to receive technical specifications and implementation considerations so that I can estimate effort and plan sprints
- **As a development team lead**, I want the PRD to include acceptance criteria and testing requirements so that I can ensure quality delivery

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
